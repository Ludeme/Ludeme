Ludii is a general game system designed to play, evaluate and design a wide range of games, including board games, card games, dice games, mathematical games, and so on. [Download the Ludii player](https://ludii.games/) to explore our ever-growing database of games, test your AI search algorithms, and design your own games.

Games are described as structured sets of ludemes (units of game-related information). This allows the full range of traditional strategy games from around the world to be modelled in a single playable database for the first time. Ludii is being developed as part of the ERC-funded [Digital Ludeme Project](http://ludeme.eu/).

This GitHub profile contains various repositories related to Ludii and the project.
